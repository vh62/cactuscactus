### Things I learned from this course
<ol>
  <li>Further practiced network calls from both data and images</li>
</ol> 

### What I'm currently adding
<ol>
  <li> I am recreating this project in SwiftUI. Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTNhMgNV53s&t=1236s">Youtube Video</li>
</ol>

### Thoughts
Ideally, the user profile would not be stored in the appstorage but in the firebase backend. 
Reading and writing data to @AppStorage can be costly and affect launch time. 
This article is a really good write up on @AppStorage. <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/introducing-appstorage-in-swiftui-470a56f5ba9e">Appstorage</a>

### Thoughts
This course is really a masterpiece. Sean Allen's makes geninue mistakes along the way which only adds to the learning experience of this course. <a href="https://seanallen.co/">Sean Allen</a>. I have not modified anything from the tutorial. I want to leave it as it is as a guide for future apps. 

### Learning takeways
ARC really caught my attention in this course. <a href="https://medium.com/computed-comparisons/garbage-collection-vs-automatic-reference-counting-a420bd4c7c81">ARC vs Garbage Collection</a> <a href="https://medium.com/computed-comparisons/garbage-collection-vs-automatic-reference-counting-a420bd4c7c81">ARC explained in detail</a>

Grand central dispatch an DispatchQueues in swift. This is one big concept I still have to wrap my head around. 
Some really good links for reference include.
