## Welcome to my site

As an aspiring iOS Engineer, I am building this site to both serve as a portfolio for my projects and to document my thought processes while building these projects

<p> A tutorial from sean's allen SwiftUI course, with my own modifications. The app let's you choose and order your appetizers</p>

### Things I learned from this course
<ol>
  <li>downloading images network call</li>
  <li>@EnvironmentObject to share data between views</li>
  <li>@Appstorage for user data</li>
</ol> 

### Things I added
<ol>
  <li> Created a recommendation page that shows random items from the menu before you checkout your final order</li>
</ol>

### What I'm currently adding
<ol>
  <li> Log in screen, and integrating with firebase backend </li>
</ol>

### Thoughts
Ideally, the user profile would not be stored in the appstorage but in the firebase backend. 
Reading and writing data to @AppStorage can be costly and affect launch time. 
This article is a really good write up on @AppStorage. <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/introducing-appstorage-in-swiftui-470a56f5ba9e">Appstorage</a>
